# Plex Playlists to TV Channels for Kodi & TVHeadend
Your Plex playlists are now your own private TV channelsâ€”complete with EPG data.
Each entry loops and repeats endlessly, creating a continuous stream. The included EPG is fully compatible with TVHeadend and Kodi.
Host your favorite series and movies from Plex on your TVHeadend server, turning them into a self-hosted, private TV channel.

This tool uses a customized fork of PlexURLGen to retrieve all data from Plex and generate both JSON and EPG XML files. These files contain the necessary information to build a complete EPG, including details about the movies and episodes being played.
